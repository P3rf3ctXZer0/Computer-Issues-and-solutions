Q: My Hardrive is stuck at 100% and I cannot really use pc can you help me?
A: The first reason this is happening is something is eating the drives read write. 
In order to fix this you first need to use "Resource Monitor" and check disks. 
This is easiest to do in safe mode. In one example this was caused by Windows 11 
"Indexer" Rebuilding after each system restart. In another case it was caused by 
``SysMain`` (superfetch) service and ``Windows Search`` (Indexer) which was going 
haywire. In yet another instance the Antivirus was trying to hard to scan a 
specific folder. Which was mowing down performance. These are some but not likely 
all examples. These examples used ``Windows 11 23H2`` and 
"BitDefender Total Security``
